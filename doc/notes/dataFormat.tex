\section{Introduction}
Each objects is described below including the object's class and the methods and
format used to write the objects.  Sets are described with the associated data
object.
\\

The detector geometry of the strip sensors is defined in ~\cite{detectorGeometry}.


\section{The StripSet}
\subsection{StripSet class}
Implemented in the StripSet.hh and StripSet.cc files in the DataObjects directories.
\\

The StripSet contains a std::vector of typedef LayerStripMap with one map per layer of the detector.
The detector is dynamically defined from a geometry file and the vector and size are initialized
at run time.  Each layerStripMap is a map of key int stripNumber and adc value.  This allows
the strip data to be stored in a sparse and ordered format.
\\

Access methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item int getNumberLayers() To assist in iterating over the vector or directly over the layerMaps
\item getStrips(): const reference access to the vector using a generic method. The underlying vector container could be 
changed to several different container types without effecting the user interface.
\item getLayerStripMap(int layer): const reference access to a the strip data from a single layer. The method explicitly 
indicates that a map is retrieved since maps have access methods methods that are not common to all containers.
\item insertStrip(unsigned int layer, int stripNumber, int acd):  To insert data into the set.
\item print(ostream\&): To print to an a user specified ostream.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{StripSet IO}
Implemented in the StripSetIO.hh and StripSetIO.cc files in the Algorithms directories.
\\

Input and output to disk in controlled by the StripSetIO helper class.  Reading and writing
are performed by the readEvent and writeEvent functions.
\\

The data is stored, or ``streamed'', to disk in bit packed format to illustrate a typical way date is stored in compact
format in many experiments.  The data is stored in individual bytes or pairs of bytes for information
that does not fit in one byte.  The data structure is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Strips: In clear test to identify the Set
\item  1 byte, version: The version is checked on input to make sure the correct streamer code is being used.
\item - 1 byte, layer number: 0-9 (repeated once per layer)
\item - 1 byte, number of strips: max 256
\item -- 2 bytes. strip number and adc: strip number 11 bytes, max 2048, and acd 5 bytes, max 32. (repeated number of strips times)
\end{itemize}

Note layer numbers are not necessary to the
structure but are included to facilitate synchronization with write and read operation..
\\

A number of helper functions exist in the StripHitFunctions file in Geometry directories.  These functions
can convert from strip number and layer to local and global positions and back again and identify whether a strip number is valid
on a given layer.

\subsection{binary input and output}
Data input and output is controlled via standard C++ library binary input and
output functions. std::ofstream, ifstream.  Byte writing is performed for write and read functions as:

\begin{itemize}
\item stripdata.write reinterpret\_cast const char *(\&myInt), 1);
\item stripdata.read (myCharByte, 1);
\end{itemize}
\

\item print(ostream\&): To print to an a user specified ostream.
\end{itemize}

A number of helper functions exist in the StripHitFunctions file in Geometry directories.  These functions

plane is within the active area of the sensor.

\item print(ostream\&): To print to an a user specified ostream that iterates over
the GenHits calling the print method of each GenHit..

\subsection{GenHitSet IO}

are read from DetectorGeometry though a resolution variable exists per hit to allow for any resolution model
to be developed.  Also note that a hit is classified of as ``bad'' if it has a large ADC
value or more than two associated strips indicating that it is actually due to several overlapping hits from
different tracks.
\\
